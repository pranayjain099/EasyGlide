**Security**
Easy Glide takes security seriously. We've implemented several measures to safeguard your website and data:

  1. Data Escaping: All data displayed in the plugin is properly escaped to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.
     
  2. Nonces: Nonces are used to verify that the requests originating from the plugin settings page are intentional, preventing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
     
  3. Input Filtering and Sanitization: User input is thoroughly filtered and sanitized to prevent malicious input from compromising the integrity of the plugin or your website.
